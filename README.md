## An appointment management webapp using nodejs 

This is a web-based appointment management system originally developed for one of my subject at university.
I later implemented more features and improved code structure design to use it as one of my side project for showcase.
This is a personal project, I implemented both front-end and back-end on my own. 

## Technologies 
* Front-end: Bootstrap framework, javascript, HTML & CSS
* Back-end: Various Node.js modules, Express.js framework, MySQL database

## Basic introduction

* Users can make appointments for their dogs by selecting from a list of available time slots.
* Users can cancel or re-schedule appointments they made.
* System can generate automatic email reminders when a new appointment is made, or 24 hours prior to the appointment time.
